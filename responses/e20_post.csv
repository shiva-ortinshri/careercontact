I used to think that social work was valuable, but I wasn’t aware of the details of the career & thought that social work was more of helping people in the community, but I realised that there was a whole web of a social service sector one could explore and that it is more intricate and intriguing than given credit for","The session was already great! Thank you for the facilitation & opportunity. If anything, perhaps it would be good to let the speakers type out their comments after the webinar to any unanswered questions (if there were any), or let the speakers or moderators prepare more specific things (such as common misconceptions etc.) and to invite a wider variety / more speakers to broaden the perspectives (then again sometimes breadth over depth)","Great job moderating! The moderators summarised what the speakers said, practiced active listening where you related to what the speaker had said and leveraged on that to ask another relevant question (also gives the speaker the knowledge that they are being listened to). Thank you for organising this, and for the speakers I learnt a lot from them and I’m grateful for this opportunity :)"

Hearing from experienced professionals was insightful, as I have mostly heard from current undergraduates/fresh graduates. I was surprised to hear the competition for funding between SSAs being surfaced as an obstacle as I had expected more integration between organisations pursuing the same goal. In addition, I had imagined a less cutthroat environment due to the nature of social work as a helping profession. From the sharing, I realised that social services operate as a partially privatised sector to achieve productive efficiency but is heading towards a more collaborative front.","It was well organised and the panelists did a great job in facilitating the discussion in a respectful manner and making the speakers feel comfortable. I also appreciate that the speaker’s responses were recorded and that there was a wide range of speakers working in diverse fields and at different professional stages. Thank you for putting it together!",""
