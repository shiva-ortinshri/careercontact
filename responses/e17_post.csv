Also looking at the speakers, they are quite privileged to be able to study overseas or to travel or even to access higher education. So if there were more diverse speakers with various backgrounds, that would help more people who are not privileged backgrounds. Because right now, it just seems like you need to have overseas experience somehow to make it in Singapore's sustainable scene.
